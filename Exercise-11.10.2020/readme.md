1.  Using CSS percentages, divide your html page into 4 different rows of equal height
2.      - Row 1: Place a title (h1) and a "main image" of your choice. Make the image float on the left side of the page
    - Row 2: Place 3 imgs of your choice. The first image must be shaped as a circle. Make the other two images float on the right side of the page.
    - Row 3: Place 4 imgs of your favorite places. Make sure that if I click on an images, I'm redirected to their website (on another browser tab)
    - Row 4: Place 4 imgs of company logos and make them half transparent. When I hover on one, it must turn fully opaque.
3.  Provide an alt description to all your images
4.  Optional:

- Row 1: When I hover on the title, it must turn orange
- Row 3: When I hover on each even imgs, the size should be increased slightly and they need to have a black border of 10px
- Place a different background color on each row. When I hover on the row, make it 20% less saturated (check out HSL) and 10% larger in height.
  Notes:
  Use whatever images/topics you want. If you don't feel creative, just use random memes you find on the internet.
  Feel like aligning and distributing stuff nicely? You can use flexbox rules...
