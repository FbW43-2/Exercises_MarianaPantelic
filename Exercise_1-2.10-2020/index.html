    <p>
      Disneyland Paris, formerly Euro Disney Resort, is an entertainment resort
      in Chessy, France, a new town located 32 km (20 min) east of the centre of
      Paris. It encompasses two theme parks, many resort hotels, Disney Nature
      Resorts, a shopping, dining, and entertainment complex, and a golf course,
      in addition to several additional recreational and entertainment venues.
      Disneyland Park is the original theme park of the complex, opening with
      the resort on 12 April 1992. A second theme park, Walt Disney Studios
      Park, opened in 2002, 10 years after the original park. Disneyland Paris
      celebrated its <span class="different-color">25th anniversary</span> in
      2017. Within 25 years of opening, 320 million people visited Disneyland
      Paris, making it the most visited theme park in Europe. The Parisian
      resort is the second Disney park to open outside the United States
      following the opening of the Tokyo Disney Resort in 1983 and is the
      largest Disney resort to open outside of the United States. Disneyland
      Paris is also the only Disney resort outside of the United States to be
      completely owned by The Walt Disney Company.
    </p>
    <h2>Ownership</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="different-color">Walt Disney</span> announced a €1 billion
      ($1.25 billion) bailout plan to rescue its subsidiary Disneyland Paris,
      the Financial Times reported on 6 October 2014. The park is burdened by
      its debt, which is calculated at about €1.75 billion ($2.20 billion) and
      roughly 15 times its gross average earnings. Until June 2017, Disney only
      held a minority stake in the resort, when they bought the remaining
      shares. In 2017, The Walt Disney Company offered an informal takeover of
      Euro Disney S.C.A., buying 9% of the company from Kingdom Holding and an
      open offer of 2 euros per share for the remaining stock. This brought The
      Walt Disney Company's total ownership to 85.7%. The Walt Disney company
      will also invest an additional 1.5 Billion euros to strengthen the
      company.
    </p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <h2>Seeking a location for a European resort</h2>
    <p>
      Following the success of Disneyland in California and Walt Disney World in
      Florida, plans to build a similar theme park in Europe emerged In 1972.
      Under the leadership of E. Cardon Walker, Tokyo Disneyland opened in 1983
      in Japan with instant success, forming a catalyst for international
      expansion. In late 1984 the heads of Disney's theme park division, Dick
      Nunis and Jim Cora, presented a list of approximately 1,200 possible
      European locations for the park. Britain, France, Italy and Spain were all
      considered. However, Britain and Italy were dropped from the list due to
      both lacking a suitable expanse of flat land. By March 1985, the number of
      possible locations for the park had been reduced to four; two in France
      and two in Spain. Both nations saw the potential economic advantages of a
      Disney theme park and offered competing financing deals to Disney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael Eisner, Disney's CEO at the time, signed the first letter of
      agreement with the French government for the
      <span class="different-color">20-square-kilometre (4,940-acre)</span> site
      on 18 December 1985, and the first financial contracts were drawn up
      during the following spring. The final contract was signed by the leaders
      of the Walt Disney Company and the French government and territorial
      collectivities on 24 March 1987.[6] Construction began in August 1988, and
      in December 1990, an information centre named "Espace Euro Disney" was
      opened to show the public what was being constructed. Plans for a theme
      park next to Euro Disneyland based on the entertainment industry,
      Disney-MGM Studios Europe, quickly went into development, scheduled to
      open in 1996 with a construction budget of US$2.3 billion. The
      construction manager was Bovis.
    </p>
    <h2>Design and construction</h2>
    <p>
      In order to provide lodging to patrons, it was decided that 5,200
      Disney-owned hotel rooms would be built within the complex. In March 1988,
      Disney and a council of architects (Frank Gehry, Michael Graves, Robert
      A.M. Stern, Stanley Tigerman, and Robert Venturi) decided on an
      exclusively American theme in which each hotel would depict a region of
      the United States. At the time of the opening in April 1992, seven hotels
      collectively housing 5,800[9] rooms had been built. An entertainment,
      shopping, and dining complex based on Walt Disney World's Downtown Disney
      was designed by Frank Gehry.
    </p>
    <p>
      With its towers of oxidised silver and bronze-coloured stainless steel
      under a canopy of lights, it opened as Festival Disney. For a projected
      daily attendance of 55,000, Euro Disney planned to serve an estimated
      14,000 people per hour inside the Euro Disneyland park. In order to
      accomplish this, 29 restaurants were built inside the park (with a further
      11 restaurants built at the Euro Disney resort hotels and five at Festival
      Disney). Menus and prices were varied with an American flavour predominant
      and Disney's precedent of serving alcoholic beverages was continued in the
      park. 2,300 patio seats (30% of park seating) were installed to satisfy
      Europeans' expected preference of eating outdoors in good weather. In test
      kitchens at Walt Disney World, recipes were adapted for European tastes.
      Walter Meyer, executive chef for menu development at Euro Disney and
      executive chef of food projects development at Walt Disney World noted, "A
      few things we did need to change, but most of the time people kept telling
      us, 'Do your own thing. Do what's American'."
    </p>
    <h2>Recruitment/employment</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike Disney's American theme parks, Euro Disney aimed for
      <span class="different-color">permanent employees</span> (an estimated
      requirement of 12,000 for the theme park itself), as opposed to seasonal
      and temporary part-time employees. Casting centres were set up in Paris,
      London, and Amsterdam. However, it was understood by the French government
      and Disney that "a concentrated effort would be made to tap into the local
      French labour market". Disney sought workers with sufficient communication
      skills, who spoke two European languages (French and one other), and were
      socially outgoing. Following precedent, Euro Disney set up its own Disney
      University to train workers. 24,000 people had applied by November 1991.
    </p>
    <h2>Controversies</h2>
    <p>
      The prospect of a Disney park in France was a subject of debate and
      controversy. Critics, who included prominent French intellectuals,
      denounced what they considered to be the cultural imperialism of Euro
      Disney and felt it would encourage an unhealthy American type of
      consumerism in France. On 28 June 1992, a group of French farmers
      blockaded Euro Disney in protest of farm policies supported at the time by
      the United States. A journalist at the centre-right French newspaper Le
      Figaro wrote, "I wish with all my heart that the rebels would set fire to
      [Euro] Disneyland." Ariane Mnouchkine, a Parisian stage director, named
      the concept a "cultural Chernobyl", a phrase which would be echoed in the
      media during Euro Disney's initial years.
    </p>
    <h2>Opening day and early years</h2>
    <p>
      Euro Disney opened for employee preview and testing in March 1992. During
      this time visitors were mostly park employees and their family members,
      who tested facilities and operations. The press was able to visit the day
      before the park's opening day on 12 April. On 12 April 1992, Euro Disney
      Resort and its theme park, Euro Disneyland, officially opened (on the same
      date that Mediaset's La Cinq TV channel closed permanently). Visitors were
      warned of chaos on the roads. A government survey indicated that half a
      million people carried by 90,000 cars might attempt to enter the complex.
      French radio warned traffic to avoid the area. By midday, the car park was
      approximately half full, suggesting an attendance level below 25,000.
      Explanations of the lower-than-expected turnout included speculation that
      people heeded the advice to stay away and that the one-day strike that cut
      the direct RER railway connection to Euro Disney from the centre of Paris
      made the park inaccessible.[15] Due to the European recession that August,
      the park faced financial difficulties as there were a lack of things to do
      and an overabundance of hotels, leading to underperformance.[
    </p>
    <p>
      A new Indiana Jones roller-coaster ride was opened at Euro Disney in 1993.
      A few weeks after the ride opened there were problems with the emergency
      brakes which resulted in guest injuries.[20] In 1994, the company was
      still having financial difficulties. There were rumours that Euro Disney
      was getting close to having to file for bankruptcy. The banks and the
      backers had meetings to work out some of the financial problems facing
      Euro Disney. In March 1994 Team Disney went into negotiations with the
      banks so that they could get some help for their debt. As a last resort,
      the Walt Disney Company threatened to close the Disneyland Paris park,
      leaving the banks with the land.[
    </p>
    <h2>Financial, attendance and employment struggles</h2>
    <p>
      In May 1992, entertainment magazine The Hollywood Reporter reported that
      about 25% of Euro Disney's workforce – approximately 3,000 people – had
      resigned from their jobs because of unacceptable working conditions. It
      also reported that the park's attendance was far behind expectations. The
      disappointing attendance can be at least partly explained by the recession
      and increased unemployment, which was affecting France and most of the
      rest of the developed world at this time; when construction of the resort
      began, the economy was still on an upswing. Euro Disney S.C.A. responded
      in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, in which Robert Fitzpatrick
      claimed only 1,000 people had left their jobs. In response to the
      financial situation, Fitzpatrick ordered that the Disney-MGM Studios
      Europe project would be put on hiatus until a further decision could be
      made. Prices at the hotels were reduced. Despite these efforts in May
      1992, park attendance was around 25,000 (some reports give a figure of
      30,000) instead of the predicted 60,000. The Euro Disney Company stock
      price spiralled downwards and on 23 July 1992, Euro Disney announced an
      expected net loss in its first year of operation of approximately 300
      million French francs. During Euro Disney's first winter, hotel occupancy
      was so low that it was decided to close the Newport Bay Club hotel during
      the season.

      Despite these efforts in May 1992, park attendance was around 25,000 (some
      reports give a figure of 30,000) instead of the predicted 60,000. The Euro
      Disney Company stock price spiralled downwards and on 23 July 1992, Euro
      Disney announced an expected net loss in its first year of operation of
      approximately 300 million French francs. During Euro Disney's first
      winter, hotel occupancy was so low that it was decided to close the
      Newport Bay Club hotel during the season. Initial hopes were that each
      visitor would spend around US$33 per day, but near the end of 1992,
      analysts found spending to be around 12% lower.[22] Efforts to improve
      attendance included serving alcoholic beverages with meals inside the Euro
      Disneyland park, in response to a presumed European demand, which began 12
      June 1993. By the summer of 1994, Euro Disney was burdened with $3 billion
      worth of debt. Disney CFO Richard Nanula and Wall Street financier Steve
      Norris worked with Alwaleed's business advisor Mustafa Al Hejailan to
      rescue the overleveraged company. In that deal, the Walt Disney
      Corporation's 49 percent stake was reduced to 39 percent, the banks agreed
      to forego interest payments until 1997, Disney wrote off royalties and
      fees until 1999, and Alwaleed agreed to pay $345 million for a 24 percent
      stake in Euro Disney.
    </p>
    <h2>1995 turnaround</h2>
    <p>
      On 1 October 1994, Euro Disney changed its name to
      <span class="different-color">Disneyland Paris</span>. On 31 May 1995, a
      new attraction opened at the theme park. Space Mountain: De la Terre à la
      Lune had been planned since the inception of Euro Disneyland under the
      name Discovery Mountain, but was reserved for a revival of public
      interest. With a redesign of the attraction (which had premiered as Space
      Mountain at the Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom in 1975)
      including a "cannon launch" system, inversions, and an on-ride soundtrack,
      the US$100 million attraction was dedicated in a ceremony attended by
      celebrities such as Elton John, Claudia Schiffer, and Buzz Aldrin. On 25
      July 1995, Euro Disney S.C.A. reported its first quarterly profit of
      US$35.3 million. On 15 November 1995, the results for the fiscal year
      ending 30 September 1995, were released; in one year the theme park's
      attendance had climbed from 8.8 million to 10.7 million – an increase of
      21%. Hotel occupancy had also climbed from 60 to 68.5%. After debt
      payments, Disneyland Paris ended the year with a net profit of US$22.8
      million.
    </p>
    <h2>2000 onwards</h2>
    <p>
      As of March 2002, Disneyland Paris underwent a second name change to
      Disneyland Resort Paris. In 2002, Euro Disney S.C.A. and the Walt Disney
      Company announced another annual profit for Disneyland Paris. However, it
      then incurred a net loss in the three years following. By March 2004, the
      Walt Disney Company had agreed to write off all debt that Euro Disney
      S.C.A. owed to the Walt Disney Company. On 1 December 2003, Euro Disney
      S.C.A launched the 'Need Magic' campaign, which lasted until March 2006 to
      bring new, first-time European visitors to the resort. And by 2005, having
      been open fewer than fifteen years, Disneyland Paris had become the number
      one tourist destination for Europe, outselling the Louvre and the Eiffel
      Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      In March 2006, Disneyland Resort Paris launched the advertising campaign,
      <span class="different-color">"believe in your dreams"</span> and paired
      with the TGV East European Line to encourage European family attendance to
      the resort.[31][32] Shortly after announcing a 12% increase in revenues
      for the fiscal year of 2007, Euro Disney S.C.A. implemented a "reverse
      split" consolidation of shares of 100 to 1. August 2008 brought the
      resort's 200 millionth visitor, and made for the third consecutive year of
      growth in revenues for the resort as well as record a record of 15.3
      million visitors in attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2009, the resort demonstrated dedication to the recruitment of new
      employment positions, especially for the Christmas and summer seasons,
      which continued in 2010 and 2011 when 2,000 and 3,000 employment contracts
      being offered, respectively. The 2009 fiscal year saw a decrease in
      revenues by 7% and a net loss of 63 million[40] followed by stable
      revenues at 1.2 billion in fiscal 2010.[41] Euro Disney S.C.A. refinanced
      their debt to Walt Disney Company again for 1.3 billion euros in September
      2012.
    </p>
    <p>
      A study done by the Inter-ministerial Delegation reviewing Disneyland
      Paris' contribution to the French economy was released in time for the
      Resort's 20th anniversary in March 2012. It found that despite the
      resort's financial hardships, it has generated "37 billion euros in
      tourism-related revenues over twenty years," supports on average 55,000
      jobs in France annually, and that one job at Disneyland Paris generates
      nearly three jobs elsewhere in France. For the first time in the resort's
      history, both the Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park closed from
      14 to 17 November 2015, as part of France's national days of mourning
      following the November 2015 Paris attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      On 19 June 2017, the resort's operating company, Euro Disney S.C.A, was
      acquired by The Walt Disney Company, in the process, giving them full
      control of the resort. In December 2018, Natacha Rafalski took over as
      CEO.[45] On 1 September 2017 the resort's second nature resort opened as
      Les Villages Nature Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      On 27 February 2018, Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger announced that
      company would invest €2 billion into the Disneyland Paris resort. The Walt
      Disney Studios Park will be expanded with three new areas based upon
      Marvel, Frozen and Star Wars. In addition to the three new areas, the
      expansion includes a new lake, which will be the focal point for
      entertainment experiences and will also connect each of the new park
      areas. The first phase of the expansion will be completed in 2021. In
      April 2019, the location hosted a Dota 2 esports tournament.
    </p>
    <p>
      In March 2018, a Disney Parks West regional division was formed with
      Disneyland Resort in California, Walt Disney World in Florida, and
      Disneyland Paris under Catherine Powell, outgoing Disneyland Paris
      president. This mirrors the Disney Parks East regional division consisting
      of Shanghai Disney Resort, Hong Kong Disneyland and Walt Disney
      Attractions Japan and headed by Michael Colglazier. Natacha Rafalski was
      promoted from chief financial officer to president for Disneyland Paris in
      December 2018. In September 2019, Powell exited her post as president of
      the park west division with division dissolving and Disneyland Paris
      transferred to Disney Parks International, East region reverting to its
      prior name.
    </p>
    <p>
      On 1 June 2019, Disneyland Paris sponsored the Magical Pride Party, an
      LGBTQ celebration. Previous similar events have taken place at the park
      since 2014, but were not officially sponsored by Disney.[
    </p>
    <p>
      On 15 March 2020, in line with other Disney parks, the park was
      indefinitely shut down caused by COVID-19 pandemic. The park reopened on
      15 July 2020.
