      points as possible.

    <p>
      The park is approximately
      <span class="different-color">4,800 acres (1,942 ha)</span>, and is
      divided into two main parks that each hold separate attraction areas
      within them. The park receives around twelve million visitors a year which

      In 2018, The Walt Disney Company announced a multi-year expansion
      project.[60] It is expected to be completed by 2024 in time for the 2024
      <span class="different-color"> Summer Olympics in Paris</span>.
    </p>
    <h2>Hotels</h2>
    <p>
      The complex features six Disneyland Paris hotels. The Disneyland Hotel is
      located over the entrance of the Disneyland Park and is marketed as the
      most prestigious hotel on property. A body of water known as Lake Disney
      is surrounded by Disney's Hotel New York — The Art of Marvel, Disney's
      Newport Bay Club, and Disney's Sequoia Lodge. Disney's Hotel Cheyenne and
      Disney's Hotel Santa Fe are located near Lake Disney; Disney's Davy
      Crockett Ranch is located in a woodland area outside the resort perimeter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disneyland Paris includes six on-site partner hotels that are not managed
      by The Walt Disney Company but provide free shuttle buses to the parks:
      B&B Hotel, Algonquin's Explorers Hotel, Vienna House Dream Castle Hotel,
      Vienna House Magic Circus Hotel, Kyriad Hotel, and Radisson Blu Hotel.
      There are also 2 associated hotels located in Val d'Europe: Adagio
      Marne-la-Vallée Val d’Europe and Hôtel l’Élysée Val d’Europe. Disney's
      Hotel New York - The Art of Marvel is currently closed for renovation. The
      reopening is scheduled for 15 June 2020.
    </p>
    <h2>Transport</h2>
    <p>
      A railway station, Marne-la-Vallée–Chessy, is located between the theme
      parks and Disney Village. It opened on 1 April 1992 and is notably served
      by regional express line RER A which provides a direct connection with the
      centre of Paris and for further connections, direct to Paris - Gare de
      Lyon. The railway station is also served by long-distance high-speed TGV
      and Ouigo trains offering direct services to many cities across France.
      There are services from and to London St Pancras International, Ebbsfleet
      International and Ashford International by Eurostar. There are also Thalys
      services to both Brussels and Amsterdam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Free shuttle buses provide transport to all Disney hotels and Les Villages
      Nature® Paris (except Disney's Davy Crockett Ranch) and Associated Hotels.
    </p>
    <h2>Backstage Disney</h2>
    <p>
      Disneyland Paris has strict rules designed to prevent guests from seeing
      backstage areas of the park. Photography and filming are strictly
      forbidden in all backstage areas. The edges of the parks are lined with
      ride buildings and foliage to hide areas that are not for the public to
      see. Numerous area gates allow entrance into the park for cast members,
      parade floats, etc. When area gates around the park are open, anything
      that can be seen through them is considered to be on-stage and part of the
      Disney Magic. Therefore, from the moment the gates are open, all of the
      cast must be in character and in place to 'perform'. As the complex is so
      big, shuttle buses take cast members to different parts of the parks via
      service roads located around the perimeter of the parks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many attractions are housed in large, soundstage-like buildings called
      "show buildings", some of which are partially or completely disguised by
      external theming. Most show buildings have off-white flat roofs that
      support HVAC units and footpaths for maintenance cast members. Housed
      inside show buildings are the actual attractions, which include hidden
      walkways, service areas, control rooms, and other backstage operations.
    </p>
    <h2>Electroland Festival</h2>
    <p>
      On 8 July 2017, Disneyland hosted its first-ever EDM festival entitled
      Electroland, in celebration of Disneyland Paris’ 25th anniversary. Steve
      Aoki, NERVO & Michael Calfan were the main highlights of the first
      edition.[64] The second edition of the festival was held on 29 and 30 June
      2018 which featured Afrojack, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Klingande, Robin
      Schulz, Bob Sinclair, Mosimann and Lovely Laura & Ben Santiago. The third
      edition was held over a span of 3 days from 5 July through to 7 July in
      2019. The theme of the third edition was based upon Disney's movie The
      Lion King. The lineup included Steve Aoki , Nervo , Showtek ,The Magician
      , Nicky Romero, Alesso , Armin Van Buuren, Nora En Pure etc. Disneyland
      also announced the fourth edition of the 3-day festival in 2020 starting
